# Building-Contours-Kunming
Building Contours Kunming Data Generated Using Deep Learning

#Introduction to the dataset
The study area of this dataset is the main urban area of Kunming City, Yunnan Province, China, and a total of 69,664 building profile elements were extracted.

#Production method
In this project, by comparing different existing deep learning models, we finally chose to build a deep learning model with MaskRCNN as the infrastructure, and use the [WHU Building Dataset](https://study.rsgis.whu.edu.cn/pages/download/building_dataset.html), [Microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints), and the hand-labelled dataset of some buildings in Kunming.
The final model is obtained by using these data sets
